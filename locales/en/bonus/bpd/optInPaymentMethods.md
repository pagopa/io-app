  The Cashback initiative has ended
</H3>
<body>
  The law n.234 of 30/12/2021 has established the end of the Cashback initiative. This means that you won’t be able to earn cashback rewards anymore.

<H3>
  What happens now?
</H3>
<body>
   The Cashback cards will be removed from the Wallet. The rewards earned in 2021 that haven’t been paid back remain valid, and will be refunded. For complaints and information on refunds, go to the website of <a href="https://www.consap.it/">CONSAP</a>, the institution that manages the programme on behalf of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
<br><br>
  All data relating to your participation in the program will be deleted by July 31, 2022. After that date, your data will be kept by CONSAP S.p.A only if they are necessary to manage complaints or litigations that are still ongoing.

      <b>If you keep them</b>, you’ll be able to use them to take part in discounts, bonuses and future initiatives or for other features, such as in-app payments. It’s not a final decision: you can delete them at any time.
      The data controller will no longer be the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but PagoPA S.p.A., the company in charge of managing the IO app. See the <a href="https://io.italia.it/app-content/tos_privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
