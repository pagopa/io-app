<body>
  There are payment methods in your Wallet that you may have added for <b>initiatives that have now expired or ended.</b>
</body>
<br />
<body>
  Coming in the next few months on IO <b>new bonuses and initiatives:</b> for this, we ask you to choose <b>whether to keep or eliminate the payment methods</b> of your Wallet. 
</body>
<H3>
  Why should I keep them?
</H3>
<body>
  Because you will be able to use them to sign up for bonuses and upcoming initiatives or <b>pay pagoPA alerts</b> without having to re-enter method data. It is not a final decision: if you change your mind, you can always eliminate them later.
</body>
<H3>
  What happens if I delete them?
</H3>
<body>
  The methods will be removed <b>definitely</b> from your Wallet. This means that if you want to use them to sign up for upcoming bonuses and initiatives or to pay pagoPA notices, you will have to add them back in.
</body>
<H3>
  What happens if I make no choice?
</H3>
<body>
  If you give us no indication by November 29, 2022, all your methods will be removed from the Wallet.
