  What happens now?

   The Cashback cards will be removed from the Wallet.

  All data relating to your participation in the program will be deleted by July 31, 2022. After that date, your data will be kept by PagoPA S.p.A only if they are necessary to manage complaints or litigations that are still ongoing.
