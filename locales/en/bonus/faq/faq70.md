No. Even if you find the function to request the Holiday Bonus in the "Payments" section of the IO app, the use of the Bonus is not associated in any way with the availability of a credit card or other payment methods saved in the app. When you use the Bonus to get a discount at the tourist accommodation where you will spend your holiday, you can pay any additional amounts related to your stay with the payment method you prefer, if accepted by the accommodation.
