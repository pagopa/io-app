The data in the summary screen of your Active Bonus, within the "Payments" section of the IO app, refers to the **maximum amounts available**: the maximum amount of the **immediate discount** that you can get from the hotelier and the maximum amount of the **tax benefit** that you can benefit from as a tax deduction in next year's tax return. 
If the cost of your holiday is lower than the maximum amount of your Holiday Bonus, both the discount and the deduction will be recalculated according to the consideration: they will be respectively 80% and 20% of the cost of your stay. Any remaining amount will no longer be expendable, as the bonus must be spent in a single solution. In the User's Guide on the Inland Revenue website you will find some useful examples and more details.
