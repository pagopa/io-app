If a member of your family has installed the app on their phone and has an active IO account, they can view it automatically in their "Payments" section. Alternatively, if you don't have an account on the IO app, using the "Share" feature on the Bonus Summary screen, the app creates a copy of the unique code and QR code, which you can share with other family members via Whatsapp or other tools available on your smartphone.
