When you apply for the Bonus, the IO app checks with INPS systems that your ISEE is below the threshold, based on the amount calculated from the data entered in the last Single Substitute Declaration (DSU) submitted by your household. Among these data, there is also the composition of the household, which is communicated to the IO app and automatically shown in the summary screen of the data related to the required Bonus, before confirming the activation.
