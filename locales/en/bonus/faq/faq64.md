If a member of your family has installed the app on their phone and has an active IO account, they can view it automatically in their "Payments" section. Alternatively, if you don't have an account on the IO app, using the "Share" feature on the Bonus Summary screen, the app creates a copy of the unique code and QR code, which you can share with other family members via Whatsapp or other tools available on your smartphone. 

It is important that you share your Bonus ONLY with the other family members authorized to spend it and/or with the tourist structure where you will spend your holiday, at the moment of paying for your stay (ask the hotelier immediately for the invoice indicating the discount obtained thanks to the Bonus Vacanze). Otherwise, you could risk that others will spend the Bonus in your place, making it unusable for all the members of your family.
