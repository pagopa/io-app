If you are in possession of all the requirements to be entitled to the benefit, the Bonus activation is almost immediate: in a few minutes, from the moment of the request, the app completes the necessary checks with the INPS systems and sends the summary data to the Inland Revenue to confirm that your Bonus is active. 
Should the verification process be slowed down for reasons independent of the app, IO will continue the verifications for you and will send you a message informing you of the timeframe within which you must complete the request, to avoid repeating the initial ISEE verification step again.
