The Holiday Bonus can be spent in the accommodation facilities participating in the initiative and located on the national territory. The Bonus attributed to your household is identified by a unique code, to which will also be associated a QR code (readable directly from your phone screen). All you have to do is communicate this code to the hotelier, together with your tax code, or show him the QR code, when paying for your stay at the accommodation where you will spend your holidays.
