It is necessary that someone in your household has submitted a Single Substitute Declaration (DSU) to INPS and that there is a valid ISEE "ordinario or corrente".
The bonus is paid to families who have an ISEE not exceeding â‚¬40,000.
If you already know that you have never submitted a DSU to INPS, or that the resulting ISEE is not type "ordinario" nor "corrente", or something has changed since the last DSU submitted (e.g. change in the number of household members, changes in assets, etc.), we advise you to submit a new application to INPS before proceeding with the application.
