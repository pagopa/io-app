It appears that your smartphone has not detected a valid card.  
Hold the card as close as possible to the back of the device. When the phone recognizes the card, it will still need a few seconds to read the data.  
If you don't know where the NFC antenna is on your device, try moving the card on the back until the app tells you to hold it in place.
