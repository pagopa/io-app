It appears that your smartphone has not detected a valid card.  
Rest it on the back of the device and try again. When the phone recognizes the card, it will still need a few seconds to read the data.  
If you don't know where the NFC antenna is on your device, try moving the card on the back until the app tells you to hold it in place.
