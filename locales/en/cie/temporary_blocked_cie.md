The card used was blocked because you tried to log in too many times with an incorrect PIN.  
No problem: you can unlock it with the **PUK code** which was delivered to you along with the card.  
To complete this operation you must however **use a special free app**, which is called **CieID**.  
You will be able to log in to IO again when you unlock the card.
