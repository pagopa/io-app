You can enter IO only with SPID, as the device you are using does not support access with Electronic Identity Card (CIE). 

Access with CIE is only supported by devices with NFC technology and Android 6.0 or higher operating system or with iPhone 7 and above with iOS 13 or higher operating system.Â For more information, [visit this website](https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/en/citizens/log-in-with-cie/).
