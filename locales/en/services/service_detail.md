**In this section you can activate or deactivate the communication related to the specific service.** It’s important to consider that the services in the IO app will write you only when they have something personalised to communicate - you won’t receive any spam or broadcast messages. For this reason, all the services are active by default when you install the app. If you receive communications that you’re not interested in or if you prefer to interact with a specific service via another channel, you can deactivate each service at moment in time, from this page. When a service is deactivated, you will no longer receive any communication by that service on the IO app: you will be contacted instead through the other available channels that service is using (mail, SMS, etc.).   
From this page, you can also set your preferences in terms of push notifications and mail forward associated to this specific service and its communications.
