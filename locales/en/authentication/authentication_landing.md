**You can register in the IO app by using your SPID identity (Public Digital Identity System) or your CIE (Electronic Identity Card).** Your security is guaranteed thanks to the use of those strong authentication methods.  
If you donâ€™t have a SPID identity and you want to request one, you can visit [spid-gov.it](https://www.spid.gov.it) and choose one of the proposed identity providers. If you are interested in applying for the CIE, you can visit the website of your municipality for more information, and book an appointment with them.
