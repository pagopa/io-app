**Here you can select the Provider of Payment Services (PSP) that you want to use for your payment.**  
We kindly remember that each provider managing pagoPA payments (PSP) can autonomously apply different costs for the transaction, based on their commercial and contractual policies: you can verify the applied fee before completing the payment.
