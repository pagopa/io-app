**Here you can select the Payment Service Provider (PSP) for your transaction.** 
pagoPA shows you by default, whenever it's possible, the issuer of your card.
Alternatively, pagoPA will pick the provider with the cheapest fee.
In any moment you can select another provider from the list: all of them are compatible with your card, even if you don't have any account with them.
