Hello! On this page we have collected some useful information to get **an overview about IO**, from the idea behind the app to the current state of open beta. 

**What is IO?**
-------------
The IO project [io.italia.it](https://io.italia.it) is an important step in the vision of digital citizenship of the Italian Government. Conceived by [Digital Transformation Team](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/) and now developed by [PagoPA S.p.A.](https://www.pagopa.it/), it aims to **simplify citizens' access to all the digital services of the Public Administration** and the rights that these guarantee.

The result of this project is [IO, the public services app](https://io.italia.it/): a single channel through which all local and national authorities (municipalities, regions, central agencies) offer their services to citizens, in a **simple and personalized way, directly on smartphones.**

Through the app, IO makes concrete the [article 64bis](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2021-07-30/_rst/capo_V-sezione_III-articolo_64-bis.html) of the [Digital Administration Code](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2021-07-30/index.html) that establishes **a single access point for all digital services** provided by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.

**The current status of the IO project**
------------------------------------
### From the closed-beta...

Since March 2019 about two thousand citizens in different territories have tested the app in closed-beta (beta "closed") version: we have given the opportunity to a limited number of people to install and test IO on their smartphone with a first set of features and real services. Objective: to identify and solve malfunctions (bugs) and optimize the user experience, thanks to the feedback collected.

### ...to open-beta 

In spring 2020, we made the "open beta" version of the app available to all citizens. It means that, today, anyone who wants it can download and install IO on their smartphone, participating in the second phase of the trial. Just as you are doing, now it is possible for everyone to start using the app knowing that it will evolve and improve continuously also thanks to the direct experience of the people for whom it is intended.<br/>
Several national and local authorities have already brought their services on board, and many will be added in the future. If you do not see your local authorities among those available, it is because their services are still in the process of integration. To find out more, ask your municipality or region if they have activated the process to be present on IO and where they are. Your voice can be an important signal!

**What's new on IO?**
-------------------------------
### Paradigm change 
IO expresses a **new vision of public services**, completely **focused on your needs**. Usually, it is you - an individual citizen - who has to understand how to access the services of the various entities and manage the requirements towards the State, on dozens of different sites and apps. **With IO, the different administrations contact you directly** through a single app, allowing you to manage operations related to a specific service **quickly, punctually and securely**, from the comfort of your smartphone. 

### The user is always at the center
The idea behind IO is to put people at the centre of the Public Administration's innovation process. The project, in fact, was born by analyzing the needs of the citizen in the main moments of interaction with public bodies and evolves with the **constant contribution of users**; this - in addition to the specific functions that allow you to send reports and suggestions to the IO team while using the app - includes moments of **co-design with citizens** in the different stages of development. In the future, if you want, your help could be valuable too!

### Open Source model
IO is a project conceived as a **collective heritage**: it has an **entirely open source** soul, i.e. based on open and collaborative development processes. All component code, documentation, discussions and development tools are **public and easily available**, as well as the interface is designed following the guidelines and using the kits proposed by [designers.italia.it](https://designers.italia.it). If you are a developer or a designer and want to contribute to the project, find out [how to do it](https://io.italia.it/sviluppatori/) on the IO website.

**Secure authentication**
-------------------------
IO is a channel through which you can receive messages from all public authorities that include your personal information such as your work, health or payments to the state. For this reason, **it is essential to be sure that whoever is using the app in your name is really you.** And that only you can access the information intended for you.<br/>
To ensure your identity to the app securely, you can access it with your **[SPID](https://innovazione.gov.it/it/progetti/spid/) credentials** or, alternatively, with your Electronic Identity Card ([CIE](https://innovazione.gov.it/it/progetti/cie/)), combined with the PIN you received when it was issued and which guarantees that you are the only one who can use it (even if the document is stolen). After the first registration, you will be able to access it more easily by typing an unlock code chosen by you or thanks to biometric recognition (fingerprint or face recognition). The unlock code and biometric data are stored encrypted only inside your phone, and are in no way sent or saved in other contexts.
