The PIN is the security code that grants your data is securely stored into the IO app.

You chose it when you logged in for the first time with your SPID credentials.

If you forgot it, you can change it at any time by pressing the "Did you forget the PIN?" button on the bottom and logging in again by your SPID credentials.

The PIN is tied to the device. For security reasons, if you will change the device, the IO app will ask you to set it again.
