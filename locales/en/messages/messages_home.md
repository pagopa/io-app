**The Messages section collects all the incoming communication from the different Administrations that offer their services through IO.** By interacting with specific messages, you can directly set reminders for deadlines or proceed to start a payment process.   
The messages are divided between received (which contain all the messages arrived in the inbox and not archived), deadlines (which display only messages that contain an expiration date, to facilitate the management of those tasks), and archived (which store all the archived messages). In order to archive a message, it’s enough to do a long press on the area of the message you wish to archive, and then select the “archive” button that appears on the screen."
