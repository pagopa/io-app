It seems like your device has been **jailbroken**.

This happens when the operating system undergoes an unusual modification or installation. The integrity of the operating system may have been compromised and the IO app may not be working properly.

If possible, please do not continue and install the IO app on a different device running an operating system which has integrity and is up-to-date.

If you continue, you agree to proceed at your own risk in interacting with the services offered, as lack of integrity may lead to data theft and/or other fraudulent activities. You also agree that the app developer is in no way liable for any damage, loss, or consequence you might incur as a result of using the IO app in this execution context.
