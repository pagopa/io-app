You can connect the calendar by interacting with the '+ Reminder' button in the preview or in the detail of the single message. The first time you select '+ Reminders', you will be asked which calendar you want to connect to the IO app: from that moment on, the reminders will be inserted directly into the indicated calendar.
At any time, you can view and edit the calendar associated with the IO app from preferences, in the 'Profile' section.
