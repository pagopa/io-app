The IO app allows you to receive different types of messages: payment notices (with the possibility of paying contextually through the app), deadline reminders, notifications and various updates.
These are not generic messages that concern the activity of the entity, but communications that concern you personally, such as a message that warns you of the expiry of a document. Don't expect to receive spam on the IO app - they will only write you services that have something important to tell you.
