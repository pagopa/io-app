Your payment methods are displayed as a card (or cards) in the top part of the screen. By interacting with this area, you can select one of the previously added methods. The three vertical dots (top right) give you access to a menu from which you can do two things: favorite/unfavorite a payment method or permanently remove the payment method from IO. If you want to remove the method, select this option and confirm.
