The details of your successful transactions can be found in the list of operations in the "Payments" section of the IO App.
However, not all payments made by you to the Public Administration are shown in the app. In particular, you will only be able to see receipts relating to pagoPA payments made through the app itself and those made online directly on the website or mobile application of the participating entities. If a payment is still not present in the list of your operations, it could depend on the fact that you have made that payment without registering with pagoPA, or by logging in with an email address without authenticating with SPID. When you enter the IO App, authenticating with your Digital Identity (SPID / CIE), you can in fact view only the pagoPA payments you made as a registered user and identified by your tax code. Finally, keep in mind that the reconciliation of the accounts of the users who registered on pagoPA before the introduction of access via SPID will be completed shortly, so that the related payments are all associated with the tax code.
