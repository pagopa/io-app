pagoPA is a system for making payments to the Public Administration simpler, safer and more transparent. pagoPA is compulsorily adopted by all public administrations and by other subjects obliged by law and by an increasing number of banks and payment institutions (Paid Service Providers - PSP). pagoPA is expected to implement art. 5 of the CAD (Digital Administration Code) and Legislative Decree 179/2012. pagoPA was born for specific reasons:

- increase the use of electronic payment methods at the country system level in consideration of the fact that payments to Creditor Bodies are relevant for the number of transactions and volumes;
- make the citizen free to choose how to pay, highlighting the commission costs;
- reduce the costs of managing collections for creditors;
- to standardize at national level the electronic methods of payment to creditors.
