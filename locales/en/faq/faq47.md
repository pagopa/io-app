All the services that use IO as a communication channel are active by default and can be found in your app. The tab 'local' offers the possibility to filter and highlight those closest to you, but you can check the full list in the 'all' tab at any time. Seeing the full list of active services does not mean that you will be disturbed by services you are not interested in: each entity can communicate with you only if they have your tax code and only when they need to send you relevant communications. Create a list of 'local' services to keep you informed about the services you will most often interact with, and use the preference options contained in each service to decide whether or not to use it within IO (activation or deactivation), and how to receive communications (message in app, push notification, forward email).
