All entities are active by default in your profile, when installing the IO app. An institution can send you messages only if it has a specific communication to be delivered to you, associated with your tax code. Your tax code is not communicated by the IO app to the institution, but each institution can use the IO app to write to you only if it already has your data (and therefore a relationship with you).
If you no longer wish to receive communications from a specific entity, you can disable its services in the 'services' section of the IO app. If you deactivate the reception of messages by an institution on the IO app, the institution will still be able to contact you through the usual communication channels in use (email, telephone or post as appropriate).
