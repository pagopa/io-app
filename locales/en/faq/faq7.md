Identity Providers provide different registration methods for free or for a fee and the respective SPIDs have different levels of security. Here are some useful parameters to consider if you don't have SPID yet and are deciding which Identity Provider to contact:

- Method of recognition that is most convenient for you when applying (in person, via the Electronic Identity Card (CIE) *, National Service Card (CNS), Digital Signature or via webcam);
- SPID security level desired;
- If you are already a customer of one of the Identity Providers, you may have a simplified registration flow;
- If you are an Italian citizen residing abroad, pay attention to who offers the service for abroad.
