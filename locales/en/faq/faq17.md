The unlock code is necessary to give a third level of authentication (in addition to username and password - first level - and OTP code - second level -), and to guarantee safe use of the app. The unlock code is asked to the user during login (if the session is still active), allowing you to quickly enter the IO app without having to re-enter your username, password and OTP each time, and as confirmation during the flow of payment or other significant actions that have a direct impact on user security (such as account cancellation).
Biometric recognition, if activated, replaces the function of the unlock code (you will be asked for either biometric recognition, or the unlock code, depending on your preferences).
The recognition through the unlock code remains active for 30 days from the last access; on the 31st day the session expires and it will be necessary to authenticate again and insert an Unlock code.
