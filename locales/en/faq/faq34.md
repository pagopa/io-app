A QR code is a two-dimensional bar code, i.e. a matrix, composed of black modules arranged inside a white square-shaped scheme. A QR code connects the physical world with the digital world: a QR code printed on a sheet can in fact be scanned by the camera of a phone to access digital content, such as a website, a payment, an article.
The QR code that you find on a payment notice is associated with a unique IUV code, which allows you to activate a payment process for a specific reason, figure and tax code - thus avoiding having to fill in this information manually during the payment procedure.
