IO has been designed and developed in accordance to the principles and rules imposed by the legislation on the protection of personal data, namely the new [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR")](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) and the [Italian Privacy Code](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2003-06-30;196!vig=) (Legislative Decree 196/2003, as recently amended). It is therefore a secure tool that protects your information and your rights. IO, however, is only a channel for Public Administrations to interact with citizens, therefore they are the owners of your personal data for their institutional functions. The IO development team is in dialogue with the [Guarantor for the protection of personal data](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home_en) in order to make IO a best practice also from the point of view of accessibility and transparency of information related to their privacy.
