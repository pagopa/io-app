In return for the provision of a payment service, the payer is required to pay a fee to his PSP. Fees for payment management are caused by the service costs that PSPs incur in order to guarantee a quality service (i.e., continuity of supply, transaction execution times that must be very short, costs of international circuits in case of payment by credit card, security and anti-fraud services, reliability of the infrastructure, etc).
