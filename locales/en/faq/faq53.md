In the top area of the "Profile" section, you can view the digital version of some of your documents, such as the tax code facsimile, the Electronic Identity Card (CIE), the Health Card (under development). 
These documents are facsimiles, i.e. they do not replace the physical document in all their usage, but they can be used to read the data and the bar code on the document by operators who request it, for example in a pharmacy or in the post office. 
By selecting the card at the top of the page, you can see the details. If you touch the facsimile again, you will see the full screen preview (for easier scanning of the code on the card).
