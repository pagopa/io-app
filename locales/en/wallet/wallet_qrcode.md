**You can proceed to the spontaneous payment of a notice with pagoPA**, the payment platform for the Public Administration. You can pay starting from a paper notice, framing the QR code you find in the notice and then proceeding with the payment directly from the app. You can also upload a QR code from your phone's gallery or proceed with the manual compilation of the warning recognition data (Notice Code).
