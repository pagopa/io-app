Any money transfer (using cash or electronic money) has a cost, which is needed to guarantee you a secure and successful payment.

Every PSP (Payment Service Provider) has its own transaction fee, depending on its commercial policies and contractual terms.

With pagoPA, these fees are crystal clear and citizens can freely choose the most convenient and cheapest option.
Please check the amount charged by the PSP before proceeding with the payment.
