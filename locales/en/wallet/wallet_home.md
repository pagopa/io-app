**The Wallet section lists your payment methods, your Bonuses and discount cards and the history of transactions made with PagoPA,** the payment platform for the Public Administration. Here you can also pay directly all the payment notices with the PagoPA logo: scan the QR code printed on the paper notice and complete the payment directly in the app. IO currently supports credit/debit card payments, but other payment methods will be added soon.
