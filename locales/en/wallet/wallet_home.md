**The Payments section lists your payment methods, your Bonuses and discount cards and the history of transactions made with PagoPA,** the payment platform for the Public Administration. If you have completed payments with PagoPA as an authenticated user before installing the IO app, you will find here the complete history of all transactions made. Here you can also pay directly the amounts received in a paper payment notice, if the latter bears the PagoPA logo: it frames the QR code you find in the paper notice and completes the payment directly from the app. IO currently only supports credit/debit card payments but soon other payment methods such as PayPal, Satispay and others will be added.
