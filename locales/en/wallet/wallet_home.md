**The Wallet section is the place where your payment methods are stored, as well as the history of your transactions that used pagoPA** (the payment platform of the Public Administration). If prior to the installation of the IO app you have completed some payments with pagoPA, as authenticated user, you will then find here the complete history of all the transactions you made.
In this section you can also pay your paper bills, if the notice you received shows the pagoPA logo: itâ€™s enough to frame the QR code to proceed to complete the payment, directly in the IO app.
Please notice that the IO app currently support credit and debit card payments only: other methods such as PayPal, Satispay and others will be added soon.
