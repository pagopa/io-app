Your payment methods and transaction history are listed here. IO integrates pagoPA, the payment platform for the Public Administration.

Currently IO only supports credit / debit cards: we will soon add other payment methods that you can easily use from the app, such as PayPal, Satispay, Bancomat Pay and others. It may therefore happen that, although you have registered payment methods, some of them do not appear, as they are still not compatible.

If you have completed payments via pagoPA as an authenticated user, you will find the relevant operations here.
If you used the web version of pagoPA with a different email from the one you associated with SPID, you may not find the payment methods previously saved and your previous operations: don't worry, you can continue to use the app and all your operations will still be recorded correctly.

If you have received a paper payment notice, and in this notice you will find the pagoPA logo, you can pay it directly from IO. Press the button <b> pay a notice </b>, frame the QR code you find in the paper notice, and complete the payment from the app, using the payment methods you saved.
