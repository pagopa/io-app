# TypeScript Development


## Core Intent

- Respect the existing architecture and coding standards.
- Prefer readable, explicit solutions over clever shortcuts.
- Extend current abstractions before inventing new ones.
- Prioritize maintainability and clarity, short methods and classes, clean code.

## General Guardrails

- Target TypeScript 5.x / ES2019 and prefer native features over polyfills.
- Use pure ES modules; never emit `require`, `module.exports`, or CommonJS helpers.
- Rely on the project's build, lint, and test scripts unless asked otherwise.
- Note design trade-offs when intent is not obvious.

## Project Organization

- Follow the repository's folder and responsibility layout for new code.
- Use camelCase filenames (e.g., `userSession.ts`, `dataService.ts`) unless told otherwise.
- Keep tests, types, and helpers near their implementation when it aids discovery.
- Reuse or extend shared utilities before adding new ones.

## Naming & Style

- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, enums, and type aliases; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants; camelCase for everything else.
- Skip interface prefixes like `I`; rely on descriptive names.
- Name things for their behavior or domain meaning, not implementation.

## Formatting & Style

- Run the repository's lint/format scripts (e.g., `yarn lint`) before submitting.
- Match the project's indentation, quote style, and trailing comma rules.
- Keep functions focused; extract helpers when logic branches grow.
- Favor immutable data and pure functions when practical.

## Type System Expectations

- Avoid `any` (implicit or explicit); prefer `unknown` plus narrowing.
- Use discriminated unions for realtime events and state machines.
- Centralize shared contracts instead of duplicating shapes.
- Express intent with TypeScript utility types (e.g., `Readonly`, `Partial`, `Record`).

## Async, Events & Error Handling

- Use `async/await`; wrap awaits in try/catch with structured errors.
- Guard edge cases early to avoid deep nesting.
- Send errors through the project's logging/telemetry utilities.
- Surface user-facing errors via the repository's notification pattern.
- Debounce configuration-driven updates and dispose resources deterministically.

## UI & UX Components

- Sanitize user or external content before rendering.
- Keep UI layers thin; push heavy logic to state managers.
- Use messaging or events to decouple UI from business logic.

## Testing Expectations

- Add or update unit tests with the project's framework and naming style.
- Run targeted test scripts for quick feedback before submitting.
- Avoid brittle timing assertions; prefer fake timers or injected clocks.

## Performance & Reliability

- Lazy-load heavy dependencies and dispose them when done.
- Defer expensive work until users need it.
- Batch or debounce high-frequency events to reduce thrash.
- Track resource lifetimes to prevent leaks.

## Documentation & Comments

- Add JSDoc to public APIs; include `@remarks` or `@example` when helpful.
- Write comments that capture intent, and remove stale notes during refactors.
- Update architecture or design docs when introducing significant patterns.
