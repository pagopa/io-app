  for reference.

### react-native-calendar-events+2.2.0.patch

Created on **16/01/2023**

#### Reason:

- This patch fixes a crash on Android devices when trying to find/create/remove calendar events.
  An Event has an Id property which type may be a long but the library deals only with Java's signed int32.
  This was fine as long as each event was originally created and handled using this library only but 
  initially another library was used, react-native-add-calendar-event, which treated event's Id as long
