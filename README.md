## FAQ

### What is the Digital Citizenship project?

Digital Citizenship aims at bringing citizens to the center of the Italian public administrations services.

The project comprises two main components:

* a platform made of elements that enable the development of citizen-centric digital services;
* an interface for citizens to manage their data and their digital citizen profiles.

### What is the Digital Citizenship mobile app?

The Digital Citizenship mobile app is a native mobile application for iOS and Android with a dual purpose:

* To be an interface for citizens to manage their data and their digital citizen profile;
* To act as _reference implementation_ of the integrations with the Digital Citizenship platform.

### Who develops the app?

The development of the app is carried out by several contributors:

* [PagoPA S.p.A.](https://www.pagopa.gov.it/);
* Volunteers who support the project.

### Can I use the app?

Sure! However you will need a [SPID account](https://www.agid.gov.it/en/platforms/spid) or have a [CIE](https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it) to login to the app.

### How can I help you?

[Reporting bugs](https://github.com/pagopa/io-app/issues), bug fixes, [translations](https://github.com/pagopa/io-app/tree/master/locales) and generally any improvement is welcome! [Send us a Pull Request](https://github.com/pagopa/io-app/pulls)!

### What permissions are used by the IO app?

Because different platforms have different types of Permissions below we have two sections about permissions requested by the IO app for both environments (iOS and Android). Some permissions may be defined but not used. Their presence is due to dependencies with third-party modules or because they are required by the target store.

**android**

## Architecture

### SPID Authentication

The application relies on a [backend](https://github.com/pagopa/io-backend) for the authentication through SPID (the Public System for Digital Identity) and for interacting with the other components and APIs that are part of the [digital citizenship project](https://github.com/teamdigitale/digital-citizenship).

The backend implements a SAML2 Service Provider that deals with user authentication with the SPID Identity Providers (IdP).

The authentication between the application and the backend takes place via a session token, generated by the backend at the time of the authentication with the SPID IdP.

Once the backend communicates the session token to the application, it is used for all subsequent calls that the application makes to the API exposed by the backend.

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The user selects the IdP;
1. The app opens a webview on the SAML SP authentication endpoint implemented in the backend, which specifies: the entity ID of the IdP selected by the user and, as returns URL, the URL of the endpoint that generates a new session token.
1. The SAML SP logic takes over the authentication process by redirecting the user to the chosen IdP.
1. After the authentication, a redirect is made from the IdP to the backend endpoint that deals with the generation of a new session token.
1. The endpoint that generates a new token receives the SPID attributes via the HTTP header; then, it generates a new random session token and returns to the webview an HTTP redirect to an URL well-known containing the session token.
1. The app, which monitors the webview, intercepts this URL before the HTTP request is made, extracts the session token and ends the authentication flow by closing the webview.
1. Next, the session token is used by the app to make calls to the backend API.

## How to contribute

In the following there are instructions to build the app in your computer for development purposes.

### Pre-requisites

You need a recent macOS, Linux or Windows 10 based computer, and a Unix based development environment. On macOS and Linux this environment is available in the base install, while on Windows you need to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The following instructions have been tested on a macOS running Mojave, on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 and on Windows with Ubuntu 18.04 installed with WSL. The described procedure assume you are using the `bash` shell; they may work with other shells but you may need to tweak the configuration for your shell. In the following when we will refer to Linux we also mean Windows with WSL.

#### Install NodeJS and Ruby

To run the project you need to install the correct version of NodeJS and Ruby.

On macOS and Linux **we recommend the use of a virtual environment**, such as
[nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) for NodeJS, [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for Ruby 
or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) which can manage both of them under its virtual environment.

The node version used in this project is stored in [.node-version](.node-version), 
while the version of Ruby is stored in [.ruby-version](.ruby-version).

If you already have nodenv or rbenv installed and configured on your system, the correct version node will be set when you access the app directory.

Please **ensure that you are running the correct versions** before working on the project.


#### Install yarn

For the management of javascript dependencies we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

You can install it as a global command with:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Remember to set the correct version of Node in advance as suggested above.

#### Install bundler and cocoapods

Some dependencies are installed via [bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) 

Note that on Linux you do not need CocoaPods as you can only build for Android.

Bundler is a Ruby application. If you have installed a version of Ruby in your system you can use it to install the required tools with:

```
sudo gem install bundler:2.1.4
```

In some version of Linux you may not have Ruby installed. In some versions of macOS, bundler is not able to install the dependencies because the ruby provided by the system is not complete enough. 

In those cases, you need to install the bundler using the ruby installed by `asdf` using the following procedure.

```
cd <work-dir>/io-app
asdf global ruby 2.7.7
gem install bundler:2.1.4
```

Verify it was installed correctly with the command `which bundle`. It should show the installation path of the command. 

#### Only for macOS - install cocoapods
Then install cocoapods, also in this case you can use Ruby to install it:
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

#### React Native

Follow the tutorial [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and install `React Native CLI` for your operating system.

If you have a macOS system, you can follow both the tutorial for iOS and for Android. If you have a Linux or Windows system, you need only to install the development environment for Android.

### Building and launching on the simulator

#### App build configuration

As a first step, if you want to run the app in production mode, set the production configuration.

```
$ cp .env.production .env
```

You need to edit it to match your environment. Here is a still NOT complete table of the environment variables you can set (check the comments in the file for more informations)ç

| NAME                           | DEFAULT |                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEBUG_BIOMETRIC_IDENTIFICATION` | NO      | If set to "YES" an Alert is rendered with the exact result code of the biometric identification. |
| `TOT_MESSAGE_FETCH_WORKERS` | 5 | Number of workers to create for message detail fetching. This means that we will have at most a number of concurrent fetches (of the message detail) equal to the number of the workers.

_Note: The sample configuration sets the app to interface with our test environment, on which we work continuously; therefore, it may occur that some features are not always available or are fully working._


#### Dependencies

Note that IO uses a [react native module](https://github.com/pagopa/io-cie-sdk) to allow authentication through 
CIE ([Carta di Identità Elettronica](https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/)).


You can install the libraries used by the project:

```
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
$ cd ios        # skip on linux
$ pod install   # skip on linux
```

#### Generating API definitions and translations

Finally, generate the definitions from the OpenAPI specs and from the YAML translations:

```
$ yarn generate
```

#### Installation on the simulator

On Android (the device simulator must be [launched manually](https://medium.com/@deepak.gulati/running-react-native-app-on-the-android-emulator-11bf309443eb)):


```
# Perform the port forwarding
$ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081;adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000;adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
$ react-native run-android
```

On iOS (the simulator will be launched automatically):

```
$ yarn run-ios
```

_Note: the app uses CocoaPods, the project to run is therefore `ItaliaApp.xcworkspace` instead of `ItaliaApp.xcodeproj` (`run-ios` will automatically detect it)._

### Build (release)

For the release of the app on the stores we use [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/).

#### iOS

The beta distribution is done with [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/).

To release a new beta:

```
$ cd ios
$ bundle exec fastlane testflight_beta
```

#### Android

To release a new alpha:

```
$ bundle exec fastlane alpha
```

_Note: the alpha releases on Android are automatically carried by the `alpha-release-android` job on [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/pagopa/io-app) on each by merge to the master branch._

### Installation on physical devices (development)

#### iOS

For this step you’ll need to have a proper iOS development certificate on your dev machine that is also 
installed on your physical device.

To test the io-app on a real iOS device you must:
1. Open the project with Xcode and modify the bundle identifier (eg: add ‘.test’ to the existing one)  
1. Go to the 'Build Settings' tab and in the PROVISIONING_PROFILE section delete the existing ID. 
   Then select 'ios developer' in the debug field of the 'Code Signing Identity'  
1. In General tab select the 'Automatically Menage Signing' checkbox  
1. You must have an Apple id developer and select it from the 'Team' drop-down menu  
1. (Without Xcode) navigate in the io-app project and open the package.json file, in the scripts section 
   add: _"build: ios": "react-native bundle --entry-file = 'index.js' - bundle-output = '. / ios / main.jsbundle' --dev = false --platform = 'ios' "_ 
1. Open the Terminal and from the root directory project run _npm run build: ios_  
1. In Xcode navigate in the project, select _'main.jsbundle'_ and enable the checkbox on the right labeled 'ItaliaApp'
1. Always in Xcode select 'Product' -> 'Clean Build Folder'
1. On the real device connected, accept to trust the device
1. From Xcode select the device by the drop-down list and run ('Product' -> 'Run') on the iOS device, if the unit tests fail they can be disabled by going to Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Build


### Development with IO dev local server
It is super easy to setup and run. [Here](https://github.com/pagopa/io-dev-api-server) you can find all instructions.
It can be used as it is, or you can run it using the [docker image](https://github.com/pagopa/io-dev-api-server/packages).
`.env.local` is included in IO app files. It is a pre-filled config file ready to use with the local server. 
To use it, just run these commands:

`cp .env.local .env && yarn postinstall`

### Internationalization

For multi-language support the application uses:

* [react-native-i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n) for the integration of translations with user preferences
* YAML files in the directory `locales`
* A YAML-to-typescript conversion script (`generate:locales`).

To add a new language you must:

1. Clone the repository
1. Create a new directory under [locales](locales) using the language code as the name (e.g. `es` for Spanish, `de` for German, etc...).
1. Copy the content from the base language [locales/en](en)(`en`).
1. Proceed with the translation by editing the YAML and Markdown files.
    - if is a YAML file (`*.yml`) translate only the text following the colon (e.g. `today:` **`"today"`** become in italian `today:` **`"oggi"`**).
    - if is a Mardown file (`*.md`) translate the text leaving the formatting as is.
1. Check that the command: ```npm run generate:locales``` (or ```yarn generate:locales```) returns a success message.
1. Create a PR using as title `Internationalization {New Language}` (e.g. `Internationalization Italiano`)and apply the label `internationalization`.

If you want to see the result in the app you must:

1. Run the command: ```npm run generate:locales```.
1. Edit the file [ts/i18n.ts](ts/i18n.ts) by adding the new language in the variable `I18n.translations`.

    E.g. for German
    ```
    I18n.translations = {
      en: locales.localeEN,
      it: locales.localeIT
    };
    ```
    become
    ```
    I18n.translations = {
      en: locales.localeEN,
      it: locales.localeIT
      de: locales.localeDE
    };
    ```

### Deep linking

The application is able to manage _deep links_. The URL scheme is: `ioit://`. The link format is `ioit://<route-name>`.

### Fonts

The application uses the font _Titillium Web_. Fonts are handled differently than Android and iOS. To use the font, `TitilliumWeb-SemiBoldItalic` example, you must apply the following properties for Android:

```css
{
  fontFamily: 'TitilliumWeb-SemiBoldItalic'
}
```

while in iOS the code to be applied is:

```css
{
  fontFamily: 'Titillium Web',
  fontWeight: '600',
  fontStyle: 'italic'
}
```

To manage fonts and variants more easily, we have created utility functions within the file [ts/theme/fonts.ts](ts/theme/fonts.ts).

### Vector graphics
Most of the images used in the app can be rendered as vector assets using SVG image format. Currently we have these groups:
- **Pictograms**: assets with an intended size greather than `56px`
- **Icons**: assets with an intended size between `16px` and `56px`
- **Logos**

Once you understand which group you must put the asset in, you must take into consideration the following instructions for the best result in terms of quality and future maintenance:

1. In your user interface design app (Figma/Sketch) make the vector path as simple as possible:
    * Detach the symbol instance to avoid destructive actions to the original source component. Feel free to use a draft or disposable project document.
    * Outline all the present strokes (unless required for dynamic stroke width, but we don't manage this case at the moment)
    * Select all the different paths and flatten into one. Now you should have a single vector layer.
    * Make sure your vector path is centered (both vertically and horizontally) in a square
2. Export your SVG with `1×` preset
3. Delete `width` and `height` attributes and leave the original `viewBox` attribute. You could easily process the image using online editors like [SVGOmg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) (enable `Prefer viewBox to width/height`)
4. To easily preview the available SVG assets, include the original SVG in the `originals` subfolder **with the same filename of your corresponding React component**.
5. If your asset is part of one of the subset, make sure to use the same prefix of the corresponding set. *E.g*: If you want to add a new pictogram related to a section, you should use the `PictogramSection…` prefix.
6. Copy all the `<path>` elements into a new React component and replace the original `<path>` with the element `<Path>` (capital P) from the `react-native-svg` package. Replace all the harcoded fill values with the generic `currentColor` value.
7. Add the dynamic size and colour (if required), replacing the hardcoded values with the corresponding props:
```jsx
import { Svg, Path } from "react-native-svg";

const IconSpid = ({ size, style }: SVGIconProps) => (
  <Svg width={size} height={size} viewBox="0 0 24 24" style={style}>
    <Path
      d="M13.615 …"
      fill="currentColor"
    />
  </Svg>
);
```
**Note:** The icon inherit the color from the parent `Svg` container

8. Add the key associated to the single pictogram/icon in the corresponding set. If you want to learn more, read the contextual documentation:
    * [Pictograms](ts/components/core/pictograms)
    * [Icons](ts/components/core/icons)
    * [Logos](ts/components/core/logos)

9. There's no need to add the new pictogram/icon in the `Design System` specific page because it happens automatically.

### Troubleshooting

### Bundler install error

If you get an error like this `Can't find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle (Gem::GemNotFoundException)` after launching `bundle install` you can fix it launching this `gem install bundler -v "$(grep -A 1 "BUNDLED WITH" Gemfile.lock | tail -n 1)`

#### iOS build warning

If, during the archive process, you see one or more warning like this `...RNTextInputMask.o)) was built for newer iOS version (10.3) than being linked (9.0)` you can fix it in this way:
1. Open the project io-app/ios with Xcode
1. Select the library (es. RNTextInputMask) in 'Libraries'
1. Select the name of the library under the label 'PROJECT' and change the iOS Deployment target from 10.3 to 9.0
