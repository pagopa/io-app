/**
 * A custom React Hook that returns two spacing values that must be applied at
 * the end of a ScrollView to prevent the content from being cut off.
 * Depending on what you need, you can set one of these two values as `paddingBottom`
 * using ScrollView's `contentContainerStyle` prop:
 * - `screenEndSafeArea`
 *    The amount of safe area without additional margins. For devices that don't have safe area
 *    boundaries (e.g. iPhone with home button) it returns a fallback value that prevents content
 *    from sticking to the bottom.
 * - `screenEndMargin`
 *    The total amount of space to add at the end of the ScrollView. It's a sum of the
 *    `screenSafeArea' value and the default `contentEndMargin' that should be applied
 *    at the end of each app screen.
