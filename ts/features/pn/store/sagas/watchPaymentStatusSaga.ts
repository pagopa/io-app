 * This saga is used to track a mixpanel event which is a report of

 * computed only on the payments shown in the message details screen,
 * as to say, not for the payments that may appear later in the bottom sheet.
 *
 * The algorithm behind this is to enqueue the payments that are requested
 * by the screen (since they are requested sequentially upon screen loading).
 * As soon as they update is completed and there is a match with an enqueued
 * one, the update result is paired and saved with the enqueued payment.
 * If all enqueued payments have been updated, data is ready to produce
 * the statistics required by the tracking event and this saga is terminated.
