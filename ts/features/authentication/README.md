# Authentication Domain

## Purpose

This directory encapsulates all code **exclusively** related to user authentication and session management within the application. This includes processes like login, token handling, session validation, and secure credential storage.

## Rationale (Refactoring Context)

As part of a codebase refactoring initiative, these files were grouped together to:

1.  **Improve Cohesion:** Keep tightly related authentication logic (UI, state, services, types) in one place.
2.  **Enhance Discoverability:** Make it easier and faster for developers to find authentication-specific code.
3.  **Simplify Maintenance:** Streamline bug fixing and future enhancements related to authentication flows.
   
## Contents

This module typically includes:

*   Authentication-related UI screens.
*   State management logic for user session, tokens, and auth status.
*   Custom hooks specific to authentication.
*   Analytics event tracking specific to authentication flows
*   Type definitions relevant to authentication data structures.
*   Utility functions for tasks like token handling or validation.

## Guideline

All new code **strictly** concerning user sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, session persistence, token management, or related authentication flows should reside within this module.
