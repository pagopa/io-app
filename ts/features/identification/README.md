# Identification Domain

## Purpose

This module is responsible for verifying the user's identity and managing their session state within the application. This includes processes like login, token handling, session validation, and secure credential storage.

## Naming Convention Notice

**Context:** As part of a larger codebase refactoring effort, this module's code has been grouped under the `identification` domain folder, as it conceptually deals with establishing *who* the user is.

**Decision:** You will notice that most files, variables, and importantly, the **persisted Redux state key** within this module retain the prefix or name `authentication`.

**Rationale:**
  1. **Legacy Code:** This code originated from a previous structure where it was solely labeled "authentication".
  2. **Complexity Reduction:** Renaming all internal identifiers (files, variables, constants, function names) would be a significant effort with limited functional benefit at this stage.
  3. **Persisted State Risk:** The Redux slice (`authentication`) is persisted securely (Keystore/Keychain). **Changing the key name (`authentication`) would require a complex and potentially risky data migration** for existing users to avoid data loss or logout issues.

**Conclusion:** To maintain stability, minimize refactoring scope, and avoid breaking changes related to persisted state, the original `authentication` naming has been preserved internally, despite the domain folder being named `identification`. Please be mindful of this naming convention when working within this module.
